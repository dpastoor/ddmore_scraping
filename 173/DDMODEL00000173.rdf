    <j.2:model-has-description-long rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">The study was carried out in steps: first a PK/PD model for meropenem alone was developed, then this model was combined with a PK/PD model for colistin alone (reported previously) using shared (but strain-specific) bacterial parameters for the two drugs. Static drug experiments on colistin and meropenem in combination for concentrations predicted to provide information on the interaction were conducted and the model was updated based on this data plus previously reported dynamic time–kill data replicating the first dose interval of the meropenem and colistin combination. Lastly, predictions of dosages were made from the developed model. All bacterial count data were transformed into logarithms in the data analysis. The residual error was split into two different components: one consistent difference common for all replicates at the same time point (RES) and one replicate-specific difference (RRES) to avoid bias due to correlations between the replicates. For time points where all dilutions had bacterial counts below the limit of detection (LOD) the probability for the observation to be below the LOD was estimated using the M3 method. The average tendencies in the population (typical parameter values) were estimated along with random effects described by the residual errors. No inter-experimental variability was estimated. Sampling importance resampling (SIR) was used to assess the parameter uncertainty distribution and obtain standard errors. The population analysis software NONMEM7 with the Laplacian method and ADVAN13 was used to analyse the data.  The model structures consisted of two main parts: PD related compartments (bacterial system) and PK compartments (drug concentrations). In the bacterial system, the bacteria are either in a proliferating and drug-susceptible compartment (S) or in a resting and drug-insusceptible compartment (R). The bacteria multiply with a first-order rate constant in the susceptible compartment (kgrowth) and all bacteria have a first-order natural death rate (kdeath). The total bacterial content in the system (S+R) stimulates the transfer from the proliferating stage to the resting stage (kSR) as the number of bacteria increases. For PK, the drug concentrations in the compartments for colistin (C) and meropenem (M) drove the killing of the bacteria. The decline in drug concentration was determined by first-order elimination rate constants (ke). The PD model for colistin included a resistance (Re) development model with rate constants for development of resistance (kon) described by Emax functions and a rate constant for return to susceptibility (koff). The PD model for meropenem included a pre-existing resistant subpopulation with a reduced susceptibility to meropenem as a shift in concentration (ShiftM). For ARU522 the second subpopulations had a decreased growth rate. Drug effect of colistin (kdrug,C) for ATCC 27853 was described by a basic Emax model and for ARU552 by a linear model. Drug effect of meropenem (kdrug,M) for ATCC 27853 was described by a power model and for ARU552 by a sigmoid Emax model. In the predictions for colistin regimens, a two-compartment model for CMS disposition in combination with a one-compartment colistin PK model was used. For meropenem, a two-compartment PK model was applied.</j.2:model-has-description-long>

    <j.2:model-has-description rdf:datatype="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema#string">The model was developed to characterize the pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) relationship of colistin and meropenem alone and in combination against a WT P. aeruginosa (ATCC 27853) and a clinical meropenem-resistant isolate of P. aeruginosa (ARU552). The PK/PD model was built on static and dynamic time–kill curve in vitro data and then combined with reported PK models for colistin and meropenem and applied to show how a model-based approach could support the selection of dosages resulting in a pronounced bacterial killing.</j.2:model-has-description>
