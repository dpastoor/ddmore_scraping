# Model represented
6 different drugs (Docetaxel, Paclitaxel, Etoposide, DMDC, CPT-11, Vinflunine)
were used to developed the myelosuppression model for neutrophils and leukocites
as described in the publication. The model available at the repository illustrates
the myelosuppresion model for the case of leukocites and paclitaxel chemotherapy

# Dataset
In order to support model estimation in Monolix and NONMEM 7.3, the following
changes to the dataset were performed. No change to the structure of the model
was done. Thses changes produced only a minor impact on the OBJ function 
evaluated as MAXEVAL 0)
1. EVID column is not supported therefore rows with EVID==2 were removed and 
EVID==4 was changed to EVID==1 and the column was used as MDV 
2. Administration of dummy doses to initialise compartments is not supported. 
Those rows were removed and compartments initialise using the initial
conditions and note availability (note that model was developed with NONMEM v6, 
but is no longer needed since NONMEM 7)
