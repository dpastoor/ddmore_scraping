# Changes to the model:

Inter-occasion variability on bioavailability was removed.

In the current version of the DDMoRe framework, encoding bioavailability is only supported with 
1) depot compartments (explicit definition in the ODE system) or
2) through PK macros (only standard compartment components).

However, in the associated publication, the model uses bioavailability after IV dosing, amongst others to account for uncertainty in dose level (==> 1 is not possible). 
Also, it uses a combined linear-nonlinear elimination model (==> 2 is not possible).
