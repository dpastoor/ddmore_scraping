###### Model differences = 1) The OMEGA related to the gamma paramater was set to 0 here (estimated to 0.0216452 in the original publication) 
                           2) Code for extraction of nadir, time to recovery to baseline and time to different neutropenic grades is included
                           3) Only docetaxel is used

###### Reasons = Used to simulate for a different purpose
