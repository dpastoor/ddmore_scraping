#Differences: Uploaded model vs. related publication referred to.

###### Model differences and reasons 
a) EVID and L2 item (as in dataset and used in original model) 
not us for estimations utilising DDMoRe framework;
b) Residual error for parent (tamoxifen) and metabolite (endoxifen) 
estimated without considering correlations and as standard deviations 
(structural parameters in NONMEM as THETAs);
c) lag time handled differently by ddmore convertors than by NONMEM.
These differences led to minor differences in estimates (esp. tlag).
